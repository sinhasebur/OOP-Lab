Create a User Interface (UI) form to collect data from those who are interested in participating in the upcoming IITDU Football League.  
You must collect participants' info, such as name, phone, email, address, gender, date of birth, Degree (select the latest degree IITDU offers), and picture; game-related info, such as preferred position, whether played in inter-departmental competition, football experiences, etc. 
If the user keeps any info blank, you have to warn and do not store incomplete data. 
You must store the data in a text file. 

N.B. You can get a sample code on UI at https://github.com/saeedsiddik/OOP_2025.git
